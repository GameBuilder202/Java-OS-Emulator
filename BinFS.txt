Ideas for the format of binary FS:

TABLE:
	[HEADER] [Null terminated name] [DATA]

[HEADER] - 0x00 - File
		 - 0x01 - Folder

File:
	[DATA]:
		16 bit word - Size of cluster
		16 bit word - Address of cluster

		(Both little endian)

		More than 1 of these if file takes up more than 1 cluster
		Entries terminated by 0x00 byte

Folder:
	[DATA]:
		16 bit word - Number of entries under folder
		...
		0x0002 - End of folder entries
		No address will (hopefully) be 0x0002, so this can safely mark the end of folder entries


No, the filesystem is not 16-bit based, it just so happens that I wanted 16 bit stuff

Actual file data will start after TABLE, so none of it disturbs the reading of the TABLE

None of this is optimized for fragmentation etc. Just an idea I came up with because real FS is bloat
